# Crossmodal and Foundational Models supported by Zero-Knowledge

### How to Use This Table

1. **Crossmodal & Foundational Models**: Each row focuses on an **FMOps** dimension relevant to handling text, image, audio, or other modalities at scale within a **foundational model** framework.
2. **Zero-Knowledge Mechanisms**: These detail how **ZK proofs** can guarantee trustless verificationâ€”proving something is valid without revealing the underlying secrets.
3. **Relevance for Foundational Models**: This column clarifies how ZK methods preserve data **privacy**, maintain **compliance**, and ensure **authenticity** of crossmodal inferences.
